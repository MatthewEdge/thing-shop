## Dev Server

```sh
npm start
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.


## Production Build

```sh
npm run build
```
